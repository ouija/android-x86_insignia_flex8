# [Android-x86](https://www.android-x86.org) on the [Insignia Flex8](https://www.insigniaproducts.com/pdp/NS-P08W7100/5451211)

This repository contains kernel patches, scripts and more that I've utilized to get Android-x86 [v8.1-r2] running on a Insignia Flex8 [NS-P08W7100] tablet.

Based off [Kernel 4.18](https://osdn.net/projects/android-x86/scm/git/kernel/tree/kernel-4.18/)


To build from source, follow the instructions at [Android-x86.org](https://www.android-x86.org/source.html) and switch to the 4.18 kernel:

	cd /path/to/android/source/kernel
	git fetch x86 kernel-4.18
	git checkout FETCH_HEAD

## Instructions

* This is still under development, more info to follow.
